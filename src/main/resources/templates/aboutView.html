                    <p>Randy is the sweetest bee with the bestest honey in the world. But he has a mischievous streak. He'll trap you

                    <p>Jordan is everyone's favorite one-eyed, one-legged pirate ever. He may look scary on the outside, but he has the
                        softest, squishiest heart. He really just wears that patch to cover the eye from which he cries easily.</p>
